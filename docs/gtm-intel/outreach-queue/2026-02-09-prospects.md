## Notes & Observations

**Research Challenges:**
- Limited access to LinkedIn profiles due to rate limiting
- Twitter/X API restrictions prevented deep social search
- Focused on Medium as accessible platform with active consultant community

**Pattern Recognition:**
1. **David Cummings** is the hottest lead - already using AI for slides, wrote about it
2. **Todd Larsen** is ideal second target - writes specifically about consultant productivity
3. All prospects are content creators (bloggers/writers) - indicates they value communication
4. Multiple prospects actively discussing frameworks and methodologies

**Recommended Priority:**
1. David Cummings (highest intent - already experimenting with AI slides)
2. Todd Larsen (perfect ICP - writes about consultant automation)
3. Bryllyant (clear pain point around deliverable quality)
4. Whitney Stowell (quality-focused, values attention to detail)
5. Applied Worldwide (growing boutique with presentation needs)

**Next Steps:**
- Blake to review and approve outreach approach
