## Market Intelligence Summary

### 🚨 MAJOR FINDING: Tome Shut Down

**Key Event:** Tome (raised $81.6M at $300M valuation, 20M users) has **completely shut down**

**Implications:**
- Major competitor eliminated from market
- Tome's "generic AI slides for everyone" positioning failed
- Validates SlideTheory's consulting-specific vertical focus
- Creates user migration opportunity

**Historical Context:**
- April 2025: Discontinued Tome Slides, pivoted to sales AI
- Late 2025/Early 2026: Acquired by AngelList
- Present: Site inaccessible, user data reportedly lost

### Competitive Landscape Update
| Competitor | Status | Threat Level |
|------------|--------|--------------|
| **Tome** | ❌ SHUT DOWN | Eliminated |
| **Beautiful.ai** | ✅ Active | Medium — enterprise incumbent |
| **Gamma** | ✅ Active | High — direct overlap, thriving |

**Market Signal:** AI presentation market consolidating. Vertical specialization (consulting) > generic horizontal approach.

## Prospect Research Summary

### Qualified Prospects Identified: 5

| Priority | Name | Platform | Key Signal |
|----------|------|----------|------------|
| 🔥 Hot | David Cummings | Blog | Already using AI for slides (wrote about ChatGPT+Nano workflow) |
| 🎯 Ideal | Todd Larsen | Medium | Writes about consultant automation — perfect ICP |
| ✅ Strong | Bryllyant | Medium | Consulting collective focused on deliverable quality |
| ✅ Good | Whitney Stowell | Medium | Quality-focused consultant, values attention to detail |

**Engagement Strategy:** Comment on existing content before DM — lead with value, reference specific posts.
