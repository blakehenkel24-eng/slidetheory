## Tomorrow's Optimization Recommendation

### 📌 Priority: Implement Tome User Migration Outreach

**Rationale:** Daily brief flagged Tome experiencing "site accessibility issues" and "deployment errors." This creates a time-sensitive opportunity to capture frustrated users.

**Suggested Action:**
1. Create targeted Twitter/X search: "Tome app down" OR "Tome not working" 
2. Draft empathetic, helpful reply offering SlideTheory as alternative
3. Focus on: stability, consulting-specific features, no-deployment-error reliability

**Content Opportunity:**
- Wednesday blog post angle: "What to Do When Your AI Tool Goes Down: A Consultant's Backup Plan"
- Positions SlideTheory as reliable alternative without bashing competitor
