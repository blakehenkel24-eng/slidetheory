## 🚨 MAJOR COMPETITOR DEVELOPMENT

### Tome Has Permanently Shut Down

**What happened:** Tome, the AI presentation startup that raised $81.6M at a $300M valuation and reached 20M users in 18 months, has **discontinued its slides product and shut down entirely**. The site (tome.app) now returns a 404/deployment not found error.

**Timeline:**
- April 2025: Discontinued "Tome Slides" feature, pivoted to sales AI
- Late 2025/Early 2026: Acquired by AngelList
- Present: Site completely inaccessible — user data reportedly lost

**Key insight:** Tome failed because it prioritized user growth over monetization. They only started charging after hitting 10M users, without validating Product-Market Fit. Attempted to raise $60M at $600M valuation but the round never closed.

**Implication for SlideTheory:** Major competitor eliminated. Tome positioned as "PowerPoint killer for everyone" — generic approach failed. Consulting-specific focus is the winning differentiation.

## Competitor Landscape Update

| Competitor | Status | Positioning |
|------------|--------|-------------|
| **Tome** | ❌ SHUT DOWN | Acquired by AngelList, site offline |
| **Beautiful.ai** | ✅ Active | "Best AI Presentation Maker for Professional Decks" — Smart Slides focus |
| **Gamma** | ✅ Thriving | Survived where Tome failed — still the main competitor to watch |

**Beautiful.ai messaging:** Emphasizes time savings ("75% reduction"), professional polish without design expertise. Heavy focus on enterprise testimonials (CVENT, IDC, Wake Forest).

## Market Signal

**AI Presentation Tool Consolidation:** The market is consolidating. Tome's failure despite massive funding suggests:
1. Generic "AI slides for everyone" is not a viable standalone business
2. Vertical specialization (consulting, sales, education) is the winning strategy
3. Monetization must be validated early, not after growth

**SlideTheory positioning validated** — consultancies need purpose-built tools, not generic AI slide makers.
