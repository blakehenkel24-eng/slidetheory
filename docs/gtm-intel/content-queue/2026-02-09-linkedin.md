## The "So What?" Test Every Consultant Should Use

I learned this from a former McKinsey partner:

Before presenting any slide, ask: "So what?"

Not once. Three times.

**Example:**
- Slide says: "Revenue grew 15% this quarter"
- So what? → The company is growing faster than market
- So what? → They're gaining market share from competitors
- So what? → This validates our investment thesis for expansion

**That's your title.** Not "Q3 Revenue Growth" but "Q3 Growth Validates Market Expansion Thesis."

This simple test transforms data dumps into insight-driven narratives. It forces you to connect the dots for your audience instead of making them work for it.

The best consultants don't present information. They present conclusions.

Your client is paying for judgment, not data assembly.
