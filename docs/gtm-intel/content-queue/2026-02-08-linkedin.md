**Hook:**
> Most consulting decks fail before slide 3. Here's why — and what I'm covering this week to fix it.

**Body:**

I reviewed 50+ strategy decks last month. The pattern was brutal:

• 73% led with background/context (boring)
• 61% buried the recommendation in slide 12
• 89% used generic titles like "Market Overview"

The problem isn't the analysis. It's the **architecture**.

This week, I'm sharing the frameworks that actually move executives to action:

→ Monday: The 3-slide rule every partner uses
→ Tuesday: Why AI won't replace your judgment (but will 10x your output)
→ Wednesday: The SEO keyword strategy consultants ignore
→ Thursday: One insight that changed how I structure recommendations
→ Friday: Before/after — real deck transformation

**The preview:**

The best consultants don't start with data. They start with the decision.

Work backward from what the CEO needs to decide. Build your case around that single pivot point. Everything else is supporting evidence.

**This week's question:**

What's the #1 thing that kills your decks? Bad data, weak narrative, or death by PowerPoint?

Drop it below. I'll address the most common pain point on Friday.
