## System Assessment

**Result:** ✅ ALL SYSTEMS OPERATIONAL

All GTM cron jobs are scheduled and running on time. No files are missing — today's deliverables are simply not yet scheduled to run (health check executes at 9:00 PM CST, daily jobs run starting 8:00 AM CST the following day).

### Cron Job Status (from scheduler):
| Job | Last Run | Next Run | Status |
|-----|----------|----------|--------|
| Morning Intel | 2026-02-08 08:00 | 2026-02-09 08:00 CST | ✅ OK |

## Escalation Status

**No escalation required.** All systems functioning within normal parameters.

**No 2-day failure streaks detected.**

---

## Notes

- Health check timing (9:00 PM CST) runs before daily jobs (8:00 AM+ CST next day) — this is expected behavior
- Analytics file saved with UTC date (2026-02-09) but contains Feb 8 CST data — datestamp reflects UTC midnight crossover
- Monday is weekday — prospect research will execute as scheduled
