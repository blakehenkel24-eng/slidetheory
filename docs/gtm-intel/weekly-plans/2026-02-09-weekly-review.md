- 🎯 **Immediate opportunity identified** — Competitor Tome experiencing site instability; potential user migration window

## Content Performance Review

### What Was Created This Week

| Date | Platform | Content Type | Status | Theme |
|------|----------|--------------|--------|-------|
| 2026-02-08 | LinkedIn | Week-ahead preview | Ready for review | Teaser/anticipation builder |

### Content Theme Analysis

**Approach:** The Sunday preview post follows a "content marketing for the content" meta-strategy:

1. **Hook:** Bold statement about consulting deck failures (73% lead with background, 61% bury recommendations)
2. **Value Preview:** Teases 5 daily frameworks for the week ahead
3. **Authority:** Positions SlideTheory as insider with access to "50+ strategy decks"
4. **Engagement:** Question-based CTA asking followers to share their #1 deck pain point

**Strategic Intent:** Build anticipation for daily content drops and train the algorithm to prioritize posts via comment engagement.

### Content Queue Status

- **Ready to publish:** 1 piece (LinkedIn preview)
- **Pending review:** 1 piece
- **Blake action required:** Approve and schedule first post

## Market Intelligence Insights

### Competitor Landscape (as of 2026-02-08)

| Competitor | Status | Key Movement | Implication |
|------------|--------|--------------|-------------|
| **Beautiful.ai** | Stable | No changes; same enterprise positioning | Incumbent to displace with consulting-specific features |
| **Gamma** | Active | Added AI chat + web research with citations | Feature overlap with consultant needs; monitor closely |
| **Tome** | ⚠️ Unstable | Site accessibility issues, deployment errors | **Time-sensitive opportunity** — potential user migration |

### Industry Trends Detected

1. **AI Integration & Digital Transformation** — Highest demand consulting expertise in 2026
2. **Skills-Based Organizational Restructuring** — Major shift from role-based to skills-based teams
3. **Consulting Market Optimism** — 47% of UK consultants optimistic about 3-year growth (Feb 2026 FT survey)

### Competitive Implications

- **Gamma's citations feature** is directionally aligned with SlideTheory's roadmap; may need to accelerate prioritization
- **Tome instability** creates a window (likely days, not weeks) to capture frustrated users with targeted outreach
- **Strong consulting market tailwinds** — B2B tools targeting this segment have favorable macro conditions

---

## 3 Priorities for Next Week

### 1. 🎯 Capitalize on Tome Instability (High Urgency)

**Action:** Launch targeted outreach to frustrated Tome users

**Tactics:**
- Twitter/X search: `"Tome app down" OR "Tome not working" OR "Tome error"`
- Monitor r/consulting and r/ProductManagement for complaints
- Draft empathetic reply offering SlideTheory as stable alternative
- Focus messaging: reliability, consulting-specific features, no-deployment errors

**Owner:** GTM Prospecting Agent  
**Deadline:** Wednesday, Feb 11

---

### 2. 📈 Establish Content Publishing Cadence

**Action:** Blake to approve and publish first LinkedIn post; system queues remaining week's content

**Tactics:**
- Publish Sunday preview post (already created)
- Generate Monday–Friday content as scheduled:
  - Monday: 3-slide rule framework
  - Tuesday: AI judgment vs. output thread
  - Wednesday: SEO keyword strategy for consultants
  - Thursday: Newsletter deep-dive
  - Friday: Before/after case study

**Owner:** Blake (approval) + GTM Content Agent (creation)  
**Deadline:** Daily, starting Monday Feb 10

---

### 3. 🛠️ Build Skills-Based Org Design Template

**Action:** Create SlideTheory template for trending consulting topic

**Rationale:** Daily brief identified "skills-based organizational restructuring" as a hot topic. Creating a ready-made template positions SlideTheory as ahead of market trends.

**Deliverable:**
- Full pitch deck template (title slide, situation, approach, recommendation, next steps)
- Framework explanation document
- LinkedIn post announcing template

**Owner:** Content Agent + Template Library  
**Deadline:** Friday, Feb 14

---

## 1 Experiment to Run

### Experiment: LinkedIn Preview Format A/B Test

**Hypothesis:** Posts that preview upcoming content ("This week I'm covering...") generate higher engagement than standalone educational posts because they create anticipation and train return behavior.

**Test Design:**

| Variant | Approach | Duration |
|---------|----------|----------|
| **Control** | Standalone educational posts (no preview) | Week of Feb 10–14 |
| **Treatment** | Preview-style posts with daily framework teases | Week of Feb 17–21 |

**Metrics:**
- Engagement rate (likes + comments + shares / impressions)
- Follower growth rate
- Comment sentiment (are people expressing anticipation?)
- Profile visits from content

**Decision Criteria:**
- If Treatment shows >20% higher engagement → Adopt preview format as standard
- If no significant difference → Continue testing other formats
- If Control outperforms → Revert and test different variable

**Owner:** GTM Analytics Agent  
**Start Date:** Monday, February 17, 2026

## System Health Check

### Failure Analysis

- **Consecutive successful runs:** 5/5 jobs
- **Average job duration:** 26 seconds (well within limits)
- **System uptime:** 100% (48 hours since activation)

### Non-GTM Issue Flagged

- ⚠️ `morning-update` job (separate system) showing Telegram delivery errors
- **Impact:** Low — unrelated to GTM engine
- **Action:** Monitor for 2+ day failure streak before escalation

### Resource Utilization

- **Disk usage:** Normal
- **API rate limits:** Not approached
- **External service health:** All dependencies operational

## Strategic Reflections

### What's Working

1. **System reliability** — No failures, all jobs running as scheduled
2. **Content quality** — First piece demonstrates understanding of consulting pain points
3. **Intelligence gathering** — Daily briefs surfacing actionable competitive insights

### What Needs Attention

1. **Publishing bottleneck** — Content is being created but requires Blake approval to publish; consider auto-publishing trusted formats
2. **Low data volume** — Only 2 days of operation means performance insights are preliminary
3. **Prospecting not yet active** — Weekday-only jobs haven't run yet; first batch of 5 prospects expected Monday

### Long-Term Trends to Watch

- **Competition intensifying** — Gamma adding consultant-aligned features signals market recognition
- **Content differentiation** — Need to establish unique voice as AI content tools proliferate
- **Macro tailwinds** — Consulting market optimism suggests favorable fundraising/customer acquisition environment
