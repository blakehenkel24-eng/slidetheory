# McKinsey/BCG/Bain Slide Design Knowledge Base

## 1. The Pyramid Principle (Core Structure)

**Definition:** Start with the main point (top of pyramid), then provide supporting arguments, then data/details.

**Slide Structure:**
```
[Title: Main Point/Key Takeaway]
    ↓
[Subheadings: Key Arguments]  
    ↓
[Body: Supporting Data/Details]
```

**Rule:** Every idea summarizes all ideas below it. Nothing in the title should not be in the body. Nothing in the body should be irrelevant to the title.

---

## 2. Action Titles (Critical)

**Bad:** "Revenue Analysis" (descriptive)
**Good:** "Revenue growth accelerated to 15% driven by digital channels" (action-oriented)

**Requirements:**
- Must articulate the key implication or "so-what"
- Must be a complete sentence
- Must include the insight, not just the topic
- Length: ideally 5-12 words
- Should answer "What should the audience know/understand/do?"

**Formula:** [Subject] + [Action/Change] + [Key Driver/Result]

---

## 3. Slide Anatomy (Every Slide Must Have)

1. **Action Title** (Top)
   - Single sentence with key takeaway
   - Bold, prominent
   - Articulates the "so-what"

2. **Subheadings** (Middle)
   - Logical groupings of supporting points
   - Usually 2-4 subheadings per slide
   - Should be mutually exclusive

3. **Slide Body** (Bottom)
   - Data, charts, text supporting subheadings
   - Charts, numbers, qualitative insights
   - Footer with sources/dates

---

## 4. MECE Principle (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive)

**Definition:** Break down problems into categories that don't overlap (mutually exclusive) and cover all possibilities (collectively exhaustive).

**Example (Bad - Overlapping):**
- Revenue by geography
- Revenue by product line
(Products exist in multiple geographies = overlap)

**Example (Good - MECE):**
- Revenue by customer segment
- Revenue by channel
(These dimensions are independent)

**Slide Application:**
- Subheadings should be MECE
- Supporting points should be MECE
- No gaps, no overlaps

---

## 5. Slide Layout Types (When to Use Each)

### Executive Summary
**Use:** Opening slide, high-level overview
**Structure:** 
- Title with main recommendation
- 3-4 key supporting bullets
- Maybe one chart showing the "big picture"

### Issue Tree
**Use:** Breaking down complex problems
**Structure:**
- Root problem at top
- 2-4 branches (MECE)
- Further breakdown under each branch
**Best for:** Diagnostic slides, problem decomposition

### 2x2 Matrix
**Use:** Comparing options on two dimensions
**Structure:**
- X-axis: Dimension 1
- Y-axis: Dimension 2  
- 4 quadrants with different strategic implications
**Best for:** Portfolio analysis, strategic positioning

### Waterfall Chart
**Use:** Showing progression or breakdown
**Structure:**
- Starting value
- Step-by-step additions/subtractions
- Ending value
**Best for:** Financial bridges, explaining variance

### Comparison
**Use:** Side-by-side option analysis
**Structure:**
- Columns for different options
- Rows for evaluation criteria
- Clear recommendation at top
**Best for:** Option evaluation, vendor selection

### Process Flow
**Use:** Step-by-step workflows
**Structure:**
- Sequential steps with arrows
- Decision diamonds where needed
- Clear start and end points
**Best for:** Operating models, implementation plans

## 6. Data Visualization Standards

### Chart Selection Guide
| Data Type | Best Chart | Avoid |
|-----------|-----------|-------|
| Trend over time | Line chart | Pie chart |
| Part-to-whole | Stacked bar | 3D anything |
| Comparison | Bar chart | Radar chart |
| Correlation | Scatter plot | Dual axis |
| Distribution | Histogram | Area chart |

### Chart Best Practices
- **Title the chart** with the insight (not just description)
- **Label axes** clearly with units
- **Use consistent colors** (positive = green/blue, negative = red)
- **Limit categories** to 5-7 max
- **Sort data** purposefully (descending, chronological, etc.)
- **Source line** at bottom right

### Number Formatting
- Use K/M/B for thousands/millions/billions
- One decimal place max unless precision needed
- Percentages: show base size in parentheses
- Currency: pick one (usually USD) and be consistent

## 7. Consulting Slide Templates by Type

### Financial/Performance Slide
```
Title: Revenue growth accelerated to 15% driven by digital channels

[Chart: Revenue trend line showing acceleration]

Key Drivers:
• Digital revenue: +45% YoY (from $50M to $73M)
• Store revenue: -5% YoY (challenging comps)
• New markets: +12% contribution

Implication:
Digital transformation is working; recommend doubling down
```

### Recommendation Slide
```
Title: Accelerate digital transformation to capture $50M opportunity

Recommended Actions:
1. Invest $10M in e-commerce platform (ROI: 3x)
2. Expand digital marketing spend by 40%
3. Launch loyalty program by Q3

Risks:
• Execution capacity constraints
• Competitive response

Next Steps:
• Board approval by March 15
• Project kickoff April 1
```

### Market Analysis Slide
```
Title: Market growing 12% annually with three distinct segments

[Chart: Market size by segment, growth rates]

Segment Breakdown:
• Premium: $2B, 8% growth, high margins
• Mid-market: $3B, 15% growth, consolidating
• Value: $1B, 5% growth, price pressure

Our Position:
Strong in premium, opportunity in mid-market
```

### Org/Process Slide
```
Title: Current approval process creates 3-week delays

[Process flow diagram showing bottlenecks]

Key Issues:
• 5 approval layers (should be 2)
• No SLA tracking
• 40% of requests lack complete info

Recommendation:
Streamline to 2 layers, implement SLA dashboard
```

## 8. Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Descriptive titles** instead of action titles
2. **Data without insights** - "so what?" is missing
3. **Too much text** - bullets should be 1-2 lines max
4. **Inconsistent formatting** - fonts, colors, spacing
5. **Missing source lines** - where did this data come from?
6. **Overlapping categories** - violates MECE
7. **3D charts** - harder to read, never use
8. **Chart junk** - gridlines, borders that don't add value

---

## 9. Quality Checklist (Before Finalizing)

- [ ] Title is an action title with clear insight
- [ ] MECE structure throughout
- [ ] Pyramid principle followed (top-down)
- [ ] All data has sources
- [ ] Chart type matches data story
- [ ] Numbers formatted consistently
- [ ] No orphan words (stray words on lines)
- [ ] Color scheme consistent
- [ ] "So what?" is clear

---

## 10. Tone & Language Standards

**Executive Tone:**
- Confident but not arrogant
- Data-driven but not drowning in detail
- Action-oriented
- Strategic, not tactical

**Words to Use:**
- Accelerate, capture, leverage, unlock, drive
- Opportunity, potential, strategic imperative
- Evidence-based, our analysis shows

**Words to Avoid:**
- Try, attempt, maybe, possibly
- Obviously, clearly (if it were obvious, wouldn't need the slide)
- Very, really, quite (weak qualifiers)
- Jargon without explanation
